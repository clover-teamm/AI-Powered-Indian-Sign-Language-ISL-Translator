# 🤟 AI-Powered Indian Sign Language (ISL) Translator – Web Version

## 📌 Overview

The **AI-Powered Indian Sign Language Translator** is a web-based application designed to bridge the communication gap between the **deaf and hard-of-hearing community** and people who use spoken or written language (English/Hindi).

It converts **speech or text into Indian Sign Language (ISL)** gestures in real-time. In future phases, the system will also recognize ISL gestures via a webcam and translate them into text or speech.

The initial version focuses on a **website** for accessibility, with plans to expand into **mobile apps** for Android and iOS.
