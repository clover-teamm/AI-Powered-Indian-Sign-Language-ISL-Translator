# AI-Powered-Indian-Sign-Language-ISL-Translator
This project is a web-based AI tool that bridges the communication gap between the deaf and hard-of-hearing community and people who use spoken or written language (English/Hindi). It converts speech or text into Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures and, in later phases, will also convert ISL gestures (captured via webcam) back into text or speech.
